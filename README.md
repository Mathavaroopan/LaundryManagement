4. A small scale laundry service provider wants to develop a system to maintain their customer
details. Laundryservice should be able to create/view/update their customer details in the system. The
system should generate a transaction slip with a unique ID when a customer deposits clothes
for laundering. The slip should contain details such as type of each cloth, the type of laundry
required, cost, and delivery date. A transaction
should be closed when a customer makes the payment. The
service provider should be able to generate daily/weekly/monthlyÂ reports.

we will have two login pages. one for the laundry service manager and the other one is for the customer.
these are the functions that can happen
customer gives an order that contains different types of cloths
while giving the order, the customer should make a transaction. then only the order should get accepted.
the customer should be able to see what are the orders he's given
the laundry manager should be able to see all the orders and he should be able to search using user-name as well and he should also be able to see the orders from start date to end date and last month and last week
the laundry manager should be able to send a message to the specific customer whose clothes have been washed. and the manager should also be able to send a message common message to all the customers like today laundry service won't be available due to rain.
after delivering the order, in the specific customer object's order varibale, the order should be removed

we must use standard design patterns such as singleton, observer, strategy, decorator, template, iterator, comprehension, generator and many more patterns
